This is how the calculator works

You write out the program and then compile it as follows:
gcc -o calc calc.c

After compilation the program has to be run as follows:
./calc

Then (Depending on which operator you want to use), the following has to happen:

	Enter the first number

	Enter the operator

	Enter the second number

After each of these steps you have to press enter.  Please see the example below:

	Enter the first number: 12
	Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
	Ener the second number: 12
	12.00 * 12.00 = 144.00
